## 🧭 Motivation
As sustainability reporting becomes increasingly important worldwide, I aim to analyze what factors influence a company’s environmental impact.  
This topic interests me because it combines **data science** with **corporate sustainability**, helping understand how business decisions affect the environment.

---

## 📊 Data Source & Enrichment
- **Primary dataset:** [Open Access Dataset of Corporate Environmental Impacts](https://corporate-sustainability.org/an-open-access-dataset-of-corporate-environmental-impacts/) (≈13,000 firm-year observations, 2010-2018).  
- **Enrichment plan:** I will collect and merge additional features such as:
  - Firm financial data (revenue, size, profitability)
  - Industry classification
  - Country/regional indicators (e.g., GDP, regulations)
  - ESG disclosure information (if available)

All data will be processed and cleaned in Python (Pandas, NumPy).

## 🔬 Planned Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning & EDA** – Summary stats, missing value handling, and visualizations  
2. **Hypothesis Tests** – Example: larger firms have higher environmental impact  
3. **Machine Learning Models** – Regression and Random Forests to predict environmental impact  
4. **Visualization** – Trends by region, sector, and model performance  
5. **Ethics** – Transparency in methods and limitations (self-reported data bias)

---

## 🧱 Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work
- Data availability and merging issues  
- Possible bias in corporate self-reporting  
- Future: extend dataset with newer years and include social/governance indicators
